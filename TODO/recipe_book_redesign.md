# Recipe Book Page Redesign TODO

## Goals
- Create a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly Recipe Book page
- Focus on a single, responsive grid view for all recipes
- Improve discoverability, accessibility, and mobile usability

## Suggestions

1. **Responsive Card Grid**
   - Display each recipe as a card (Bootstrap card or custom)
   - Show recipe name, thumbnail image (or placeholder), short description, and key tags/badges
   - Include a "View" or "Open" button on each card

2. **Search and Filter**
   - Prominent search bar at the top
   - Optional: Add filter chips or dropdowns for class, type, or tags

3. **Remove Table/List View**
   - Remove the table/list toggle and only show the grid
   - Simplify the interface and reduce clutter

4. **Recipe Actions**
   - Floating “Add Recipe” button (plus icon) for admins
   - Each card can have a small menu (⋮) for edit/delete (admin only)

5. **Visual Polish**
   - Use soft card shadows, rounded corners, and a light background
   - Add hover effects to cards (slight lift or highlight)
   - Use consistent spacing and alignment

6. **Accessibility & Mobile**
   - Ensure cards stack vertically on mobile
   - Use large touch targets and readable font sizes

7. **Featured or Recently Added Section (Optional)**
   - Highlight new or popular recipes at the top
