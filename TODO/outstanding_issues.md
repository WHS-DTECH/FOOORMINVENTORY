# Outstanding Issues (as of 2026-01-20)

## Parser Debug
- General improvements, error handling, and workflow consistency for all debug/confirm actions. Ensure all debug routes and index actions work reliably and display clear errors or results.

## Parser Debug / URL Upload Review - FIXED
- Need to get to the Flag window from the Parser Debug Index (see screenshot for current state). Ensure that clicking 'Debug' on a URL entry leads to the review/flagging workflow as intended.

## Book a Class - FIXED
- Edit function does not save edits to the existing record. (Editing a booking pre-fills the form, but saving does not update the record in the database.)

## Book the Shopping
- Untick function works perfectly (resets recipe and ingredient panels as expected).
- Tick function (when selecting a teacher/class) to choose recipe for single serve: No link is working correctly (recipe dropdown and ingredient panels do not update as expected when ticking a class).
