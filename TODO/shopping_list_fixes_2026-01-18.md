# TODO: Shopping List Page Fixes (2026-01-18)

## 1. Fix Booking Click Selection
- [ ] Ensure clicking on a booking in the grid toggles its selection (highlight and add/remove from Selected Bookings panel)
- [ ] Debug and restore the JS event handler for booking selection
- [ ] Confirm that selection persists and updates the UI as expected

## 2. Fix Generate Shopping List
- [ ] Ensure the 'Generate Shopping List' button aggregates ingredients for selected bookings
- [ ] Display the correct ingredients in the Shopping List panel for each teacher
- [ ] Debug and fix any issues with recipe/ingredient matching or display

## 3. Confirm Print Shopping List Only
- [ ] Test the 'Print Shopping List Only' button
- [ ] Ensure only the shopping list prints (no extra UI elements)
- [ ] Confirm print layout is clear and readable

---
- [ ] After fixes, test all workflows: select bookings, generate list, print, and deselect/clear
- [ ] Remove debug code and console logs after confirming all features work
